[Verse]
G             Emin    C         D
why are there so many songs about rainbows,
G                 Emin  C
and what's on the other side?
G            Emin   C         D
rainbows are visions, but only illusions.
G                   Emin C
rainbows have nothing to hide.
Cmaj7
so we've been told and some choose to believe it.
Bmin7
i know they're wrong, wait and see.
Amin7          D            Bmin       E
someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
C               D             G
the lovers, the dreamers, and me.

G             Emin           C         D
who said that every wish would be heard and answered
G                   Emin C
and wished on a morning star?
G             Emin            C         D
somebody thought of that and someone believed him.
G               Emin C
look what it's done so far.
Cmaj7
what's so amazing and keeps us stargazing?
Bmin7
what do we think we might see?
Amin7         D            Bmin       E
someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
C               D             G
the lovers, the dreamers and me.
 
G             Emin            C         D
have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
G               Emin C
i've heard the-calling my name.
G             Emin              C             D
are these the sweet sounds that called the young sailors?
G               Emin C
i think they're one and the same.
Cmaj7
i've heard it too many times to ignore it.
Bmin7
it's something that I'm supposed to be.
Amin7         D            Bmin    E
someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
C               D            G
the lovers, the dreamers and me.
